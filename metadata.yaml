description: '""We do not err, we think, in calling this one of his masterpieces,
  in which we have his art at its best.""--N.Y. Evening Post. ""In every sense one
  of his best works ... It is evident throughout, that he has neither ''written out,
  '' nor lost the vein of originality and freshness which give such a charm to his
  books.""--Boston Post.'
